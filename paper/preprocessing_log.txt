Preprocessing Log - Improve Phase
==================================================

Date: 2025-10-01

Final Preprocessing Decisions:
1. Class Imbalance: SMOTE (k=5) applied during training
2. Feature Transformations: log1p on MonthlyIncome, TotalWorkingYears, YearsAtCompany
3. Outlier Treatment: Winsorization at 1st/99th percentiles for Income, YearsSince, YearsAt
4. Scaling: StandardScaler for numeric features
5. Categorical Encoding: OneHotEncoder with handle_unknown='ignore'
6. Model: RandomForestClassifier (n_estimators=200)

Rationale:
- SMOTE improved recall significantly (paired t-test p < 0.05)
- Log transform reduced skewness in key features
- RandomForest outperformed linear models on F1 score
