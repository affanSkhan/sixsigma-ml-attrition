## Title
Improving ML Model Accuracy Using Six Sigma DMAIC: A Case Study on Employee Attrition Prediction

---

## Abstract
**Context:** The high cost of employee attrition requires robust predictive models.  

**Problem:** ML models often lack a structured framework for iterative improvement.  

**Method:** We apply the Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology to systematically enhance an attrition prediction model.  

**Dataset:** The public IBM HR Analytics dataset.  

**Key Result:** Our DMAIC-driven approach significantly improved model accuracy and F1-score compared to a baseline model.  

**Implication:** This provides a reproducible, structured framework for ML model optimization in business contexts.

# 1. Introduction

## Background and Motivation
Employee attrition imposes substantial costs on organizations, affecting both finances and operational efficiency. While ML models can predict attrition, they often suffer from performance issues due to inconsistent preprocessing, noisy features, and lack of structured model improvement strategies. The Six Sigma DMAIC framework provides a systematic approach to iteratively improve processes, which we apply to the ML workflow to enhance predictive performance.

---

## Research Question
Can a structured DMAIC framework improve ML model performance for employee attrition prediction in a reproducible and measurable way?

---

## Gap Statement
Current ML approaches for attrition prediction often rely on ad-hoc tuning without a documented, systematic improvement process. There is a lack of studies integrating process improvement methodologies like DMAIC into ML workflows.

---

## Contributions
1. A novel mapping of DMAIC to the ML workflow.  
2. A reproducible case study on employee attrition prediction.  
3. Practical insights for HR analytics and ML model optimization.
