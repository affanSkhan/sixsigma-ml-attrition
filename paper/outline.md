\## Title

Improving ML Model Accuracy Using Six Sigma DMAIC: A Case Study on Employee Attrition Prediction



\## Abstract (150-200 words)

\- \*\*Context\*\*: The high cost of employee attrition requires robust predictive models.  

\- \*\*Problem\*\*: ML models often lack a structured framework for iterative improvement.  

\- \*\*Method\*\*: We apply the Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology to systematically enhance an attrition prediction model.  

\- \*\*Dataset\*\*: The public IBM HR Analytics dataset.  

\- \*\*Key Result\*\*: Our DMAIC-driven approach significantly improved model accuracy and F1-score compared to a baseline model.  

\- \*\*Implication\*\*: This provides a reproducible, structured framework for ML model optimization in business contexts.

\## 1. Introduction

\- \*\*Motivation\*\*: The business impact of employee attrition.  

\- \*\*Research Question\*\*: Can a structured process improvement framework like DMAIC measurably improve ML model performance for a business problem?  

\- \*\*Gap Statement\*\*: Lack of documented, systematic approaches for ML model improvement beyond ad-hoc tuning.  

\- \*\*Contributions\*\*:  

&nbsp; 1. A novel mapping of DMAIC to the ML workflow.  

&nbsp; 2. A reproducible case study.  

&nbsp; 3. Practical insights for HR analytics.  



\## 2. Literature Review

\- Summary of ML techniques for predicting employee attrition.  

\- Overview of Six Sigma and DMAIC in non-manufacturing domains.  

\- Identification of the research gap where these two fields intersect.  



\## 3. Methodology

\- \*\*DMAIC Framework Mapping\*\*:  

&nbsp; - \*\*Define\*\*: Problem statement, project scope, and key metrics (e.g., F1-score, Recall).  

&nbsp; - \*\*Measure\*\*: Baseline model performance.  

&nbsp; - \*\*Analyze\*\*: Statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA, Chi-squared tests) to identify key drivers of attrition and model error.  

&nbsp; - \*\*Improve\*\*: Targeted feature engineering, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning.  

&nbsp; - \*\*Control\*\*: Monitoring plan and validation of the improved model.  

\- \*\*Data Description\*\*: Details of the IBM dataset.  

\- \*\*Modeling Approach\*\*: Baseline (e.g., Logistic Regression) vs. Improved models (e.g., XGBoost). Cross-validation strategy.  



\## 4. Experiments and Results

\- Baseline model results with key metrics.  

\- Results from the Analyze phase (statistical tests).  

\- Performance of the improved model after interventions.  

\- Statistical significance tests comparing baseline and improved models.  

\- Model explainability analysis (e.g., SHAP plots).  



\## 5. Discussion

\- Interpretation of findings: Why did the improvements work?  

\- Practical implications for HR departments.  

\- Limitations of the study (e.g., dataset limitations).
